# hello-world

Salutations!
I'm a civil engineer who likes to code on the side. I went to school at a trinational program in Europe, so in addition to programming languages I'm also fluent in French and German, and hopefully will learn many more throughout my life. I consider myself a global citizen. I'm very energetic and optimistic and love learning new things about the world! I'm a quick learner and would love to learn by doing, like learning a new programming language just to work on a project I think is cool.

Programming langauges I know so far:
Python (intermediate)
Google app scripts (beginner)

I like reading books, spending time outside, and thinking about life, the universe, and everything. I also like some video games like Spore, Minecraft, or old pokemon games. 

Looking forward to collaborating!
